Explanation of Each Task

1-Create a Filesystem on the New Partition: This task creates a filesystem (ext4) on the new partition created earlier.

2-Mount the New Filesystem: This mounts the newly created filesystem to a specified mount point.

3-Ensure the Mount Point is Created: This ensures that the specified directory exists before attempting to mount the filesystem.

4-Add the New Filesystem to /etc/fstab: This adds an entry for the new filesystem in /etc/fstab, ensuring it mounts automatically on boot.

5-Resize Existing Partition: This task resizes an existing partition (if needed) to maximize available space.

6-Check Disk Space: This task checks the available disk space on all mounted filesystems and stores the output for later review.

7-Display Disk Information: This task lists block devices and their information, providing an overview of disk usage.

8-Unmount the Filesystem: This task unmounts the filesystem if it needs to be removed or modified.

9-Remove the Partition: This removes the specified partition from the disk if it is no longer needed.
