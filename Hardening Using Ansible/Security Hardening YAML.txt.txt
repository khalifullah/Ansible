Explanation of Each Task

1-Ensure SSH Protocol 2 is Used: This task ensures that only SSH protocol 2 is used for secure communication.

2-Disable Password Authentication for SSH: This task disables password authentication to enhance security, requiring the use of SSH keys instead.

3-Enable Firewall and Allow SSH: This task configures the firewall to allow SSH traffic, ensuring the firewall is active.

4-Set Inactive Session Timeout for SSH: This configures the SSH server to disconnect users after a specified period of inactivity.

5-Install and Configure Fail2ban: This task installs the fail2ban software, which helps protect against brute-force attacks.

6-Ensure Fail2ban is Enabled and Started: This ensures that the fail2ban service is running and set to start on boot.

7-Disable Unused Services: This task stops and disables unnecessary services to reduce potential attack vectors.

8-Set System Limits for Users: This task sets limits on the number of open files for users to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.
