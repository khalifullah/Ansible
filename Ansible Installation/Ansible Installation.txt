Ansible Installation:

Update the System:
Ensure your RHEL system is up to date before installing Ansible.
sudo yum update -y 

Enable EPEL Repository:
Ansible is available in the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository, so you need to enable it:
sudo yum install epel-release -y

Install Ansible:
After enabling the EPEL repository, install Ansible using the following command:
sudo yum install ansible -y

Verify the Installation:
Check if Ansible is installed correctly by verifying its version:
ansible --version

Configure Ansible Inventory:
The inventory file is where you define the managed hosts (servers). By default, it's located at /etc/ansible/hosts.
--- Open the inventory file with a text editor:
    sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

--- Add the IP addresses or hostnames of the systems you want to manage:
    [web]
    webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.xxx ansible_user=root
    webserver2 ansible_host=192.168.1.xxx ansible_user=root

    [db]
    dbserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.xxx ansible_user=root

Configure SSH Access:
Ansible communicates with managed nodes over SSH. Set up passwordless SSH access using key-based authentication.
--- Generate an SSH key (if you don't have one already):
    ssh-keygen -t rsa

--- Copy the SSH key to the managed hosts:
    ssh-copy-id root@192.168.1.xxx  # Replace with the IP address of your managed host.

Test Connectivity:
Once you have defined your hosts in the inventory file and set up SSH access, test connectivity using the ping module:
ansible all -m ping
